Evaluation
I believe that my program is successful as it meets every essential target on my success criteria apart from a few minor mistakes. The first point on my success criteria is ensuring that the quiz runs smoothly. I have accomplished this point because my quiz runs without any errors as I have conducted normal, erroneous and extreme testing to ensure this. Another point on my success criteria is that the quiz calculated the correct score and displayed at the end of the quiz. I have met this criteria as at the end of my quiz the correct score is always displayed with a message.
My third success criteria is that the questions are randomly generated in chronological order. I managed to enable the questions to the randomly generated by creating two random number generators and a random operator. My first random number was between 0 and 20 and my second between 0 and 15, with the operators being either *, + or -. This proved successful as on each quiz 10 random questions were generated, none being the same. However I did not manage to create a code which displayed each question number as I did not know the code and didn’t have enough time.
My fourth success criteria is that all messages are displayed correctly. I have met this criteria as throughout the quiz all messages are displayed without any errors. I have ensured that all messages are displayed in a print(“message”) code ensuring it works. My final success point is that the user’s answers are defiantly correct or wrong. To ensure this I wrote this code, ans = number1 (* or + or -) number2, which will calculate the correct answer and display it to the user.
Overall I believe that my quiz is successful as it meets all my requirements and my success criteria and gives the user feedback.
